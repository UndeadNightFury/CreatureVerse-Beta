You approach it and notice it patches of rot on it, you set your phylactery down next to the head. You see a bit of intestine still hanging limply out of the right side of the underbelly, you feel strangely hungry while looking at the organ.
</p>

<p>
You dig your claw into the wound and rip open the rest of the underbelly, spilling the rest of the intestines onto the ground. You begin feasting on the slimy organ, gulping it down in huge mouth fulls, soon the underbelly was hallowed out of its organs. You feel your underbelly bulged with your meal.
